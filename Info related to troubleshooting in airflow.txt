------------------------------------------------------------

I notice that the error is related to a port binding issue with PostgreSQL. The error message indicates that port 5432 is already in use or blocked. Looking at your files, I can help you resolve this issue.

1. First, the error specifically says:
```
Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:5432: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
```

2. I notice in your `docker-compose.yml` file you're trying to use port 5433, but Astronomer seems to be trying to use 5432. Here are a few steps to resolve this:

First, let's modify your setup to handle this port conflict:



```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: postgres_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: airflow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airflow
      POSTGRES_DB: airflow
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - airflow_network

networks:
  airflow_network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  postgres_data:

```

Here's what you need to do:

1. Stop any running PostgreSQL instances:
```bash
# On Windows
net stop postgresql
# Or check Task Manager and stop any PostgreSQL processes

# On Linux/Mac
sudo service postgresql stop
```

2. Kill any existing Docker containers that might be using these ports:
```bash
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker-compose down -v
```

3. Update your Airflow connection settings in the Airflow UI or via environment variables to use port 5433 instead of 5432. You'll need to set these in your Airflow connections:
```
Connection Id: postgres_default
Connection Type: Postgres
Host: postgres
Database: airflow
Login: airflow
Password: airflow
Port: 5432  # This is the internal port, keep as 5432
```

4. Before starting Astro, make sure to:
```bash
astro dev kill  # Kill any existing Astro processes
astro dev stop  # Stop any running containers
```

5. Then start your project:
```bash
astro dev start
```

If you're still having issues, you can also try:

1. Check if anything is using port 5432:
```bash
# On Windows
netstat -ano | findstr 5432

# On Linux/Mac
sudo lsof -i :5432
```

2. If you find any processes using the port, stop them or change your PostgreSQL port in the Astronomer configuration.

The key changes I made in the Docker Compose file:
- Added a dedicated network for better isolation
- Updated the default credentials to match Airflow's defaults
- Ensured the ports mapping is explicit
- Added proper networking configuration

Your ETL code looks good and shouldn't be causing this issue. The problem is purely related to port binding and container networking.
------------------------------------------------------------
if i am done, how do i stop the airflow, do i start by stopping the docker or which one should i do first to stop the whole process here ? (FOR COMPLETE CHECK THE CHAT)

Let me break this down clearly based on the tools you're using:

In VSCode Terminal:
```bash
# Stop Astro and its containers
astro dev stop

# If needed, completely kill Astro processes
astro dev kill
```

In Docker Desktop:
1. Go to the "Containers" tab
2. You can either:
   - Click the stop button (square icon) next to each running container related to your Airflow project
   - Or use the checkbox to select multiple containers and click "Stop" at the top

Optional cleanup in Docker Desktop:
1. After stopping containers:
   - Go to "Containers" tab
   - Click "Delete" (trash can icon) for stopped containers you want to remove
2. For volumes:
   - Go to "Volumes" tab
   - Select and delete unused volumes
3. For networks:
   - Go to "Networks" tab
   - Select and delete unused networks

The general sequence should be:
1. Use VSCode terminal to stop Astro first (`astro dev stop`)
2. Then use Docker Desktop to clean up any remaining containers/volumes if needed

When starting up again:
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Use VSCode terminal to run `astro dev start`

This way you're using the GUI for Docker management and the CLI for Astro-specific commands, which is typically easier to manage and visualize.
------------------------------------------------------------
i used the astro dev kill and now even the docker desktop and databases in dbeaver is gone now? is that normal? now i cant stop the docker process using stop button and other steps

Yes, that's normal behavior! When you run `astro dev kill`, it forcefully stops and removes all containers, volumes, and networks associated with your Airflow project. Here's what happened:

1. `astro dev kill` removed:
   - All Airflow-related containers
   - Associated volumes (which contained your database data)
   - Network connections
   - That's why your DBeaver connections stopped working - the database container was removed

Since the containers were forcefully removed, that's why you can't see the stop button in Docker Desktop - there's nothing running to stop.

To get everything back:

1. Start fresh by running:
```bash
astro dev start
```

2. Then you'll need to:
   - Recreate your DBeaver connection using port 5433
   - Set up your database tables again since the data volume was removed
   - Reconfigure any Airflow connections in the Airflow UI

For future reference:
- Use `astro dev stop` for normal shutdown (preserves data)
- Use `astro dev kill` only when:
  - Something is stuck
  - You want to completely reset everything
  - You're having port conflicts
  - You want to start fresh

------------------------------------------------------------

so if i want to keep the data, is it better to use astro dev stop right? and also in the professional work context in a company, is it better to use the stop if i want to stop a process?


Yes, exactly! Let me explain the best practices, especially in a professional context:

In Professional Environment:
1. ALWAYS use `astro dev stop` because:
   - It gracefully stops the processes
   - Preserves your data
   - Maintains database integrity
   - Doesn't disrupt other team members who might be connected
   - Follows proper shutdown procedures
   - Keeps your data pipeline history and logs

Only use `astro dev kill` when:
- Something is completely stuck/frozen
- You have explicit permission to reset everything
- During development/testing phase
- As a last resort after `stop` doesn't work
- You're absolutely sure you don't need any of the data

Think of it like:
- `astro dev stop` = properly shutting down a computer
- `astro dev kill` = pulling the power plug

Best Practice Workflow:
1. Normal daily shutdown:
```bash
astro dev stop
```

2. Next day startup:
```bash
astro dev start
```

This way:
- Your database data persists
- Pipeline histories are maintained
- Connections stay configured
- Team members can rely on the system state
- It's more professional and safer

Remember: In production environments, unexpected data loss can be a serious issue, so always prefer the graceful shutdown method (`stop`) unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise.
-----------------------------------------------------------

you see in my etlweather.py file before i import some of the libraries right?

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.http.hooks.http import HttpHook
from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook
from airflow.decorators import task
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

but in my terminal i saw these in the problems menu, it shows that i dont have those libraries in my local computer right? but i am still able to run the astro dev start and the whole etl process run sucessfully, why is that?

This is a great observation! Let me explain why this happens:

1. The red squiggly lines/errors you see in VSCode are from your local Python environment's perspective. VSCode is checking if these libraries exist in your local computer.

2. However, when you run `astro dev start`, your code runs inside a Docker container that Astronomer creates, NOT on your local machine. This Docker container:
   - Comes pre-installed with Airflow and all its providers
   - Uses its own Python environment
   - Has all the necessary dependencies

Here's the process:
```
Your Local Computer              Docker Container
----------------                 ----------------
❌ No Airflow                    ✅ Has Airflow
❌ No providers                  ✅ Has providers
❌ VSCode shows errors           ✅ Code runs fine
```

To fix the VSCode errors (optional):
1. Create a `requirements.txt` file:
```txt
apache-airflow
apache-airflow-providers-http
apache-airflow-providers-postgres
```

2. Install these in your local environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

BUT remember:
- These local installations are just for VSCode to stop showing errors
- They're not actually used when running your DAG
- Your DAG runs in the Astronomer container which already has everything it needs
- This is why it's a common practice in professional settings to sometimes ignore these VSCode warnings for Airflow projects

This is actually a benefit of containerization:
- Your code can run in a completely different environment than your local machine
- Everyone on the team gets the same environment through Docker
- You don't need to install everything locally

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter of username, password, etc :

Yes, your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured to match the PostgreSQL server and database information shown in your screenshot. Let me confirm the alignment:

1. **Host**: 
   - In your `docker-compose.yml`, the `postgres` service is exposed on port `5432`. The `localhost` in your screenshot would be correct if you're connecting to the PostgreSQL container from the host machine.

2. **Port**:
   - Your file exposes PostgreSQL on the default `5432` port (`ports: - "5432:5432"`), which matches the port in your screenshot.

3. **Database Name**:
   - The `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable is set to `postgres`, matching the `Maintenance database` field in the screenshot.

4. **Username and Password**:
   - The `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables are set to `postgres`, which align with the `Username` field and the expected default password configuration.

5. **Volumes**:
   - The `postgres_data` volume ensures persistent storage of your PostgreSQL data, which is a best practice.

### Additional Notes:
- **Network Connectivity**: If you're using Apache Airflow in another service within the same `docker-compose.yml`, you would refer to the PostgreSQL host as `postgres` (the name of the service) instead of `localhost` in your Airflow configuration. For example:
  ```yaml
  AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN: postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres
  ```

- **Security**: If you're deploying this in a production environment, you should use a stronger password for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` instead of the default `postgres`.

- **Testing**: After running `docker-compose up`, you can test the connection using a tool like `psql` or a GUI client (e.g., pgAdmin). Ensure that the connection details match the values in your `docker-compose.yml`.
